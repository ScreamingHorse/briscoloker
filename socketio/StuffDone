Day 9:
- Created the mongo helpers so we can await the DB
- Refactored the joinLobby storing the 'token' and the 'username' on the games collection
- Renamed closedRooms to games
- Reconnection to an existing game from '/game'
- Moved 'start game on the server'

Known issues:
- It seems that everytime a player 'reconnect' to the socket.io (reload the /game page) the server creates a new game

Todo:
- Frontend: Delete the code for new game as it is now on the server

Day 10:

- Game is now created after both players joined the lobby (join_lobby)
- Table ready sends back the state of the match, it doesn't start it
- We are passing the token as QS when connecting to the webSocket
- The betting pahse is on the server now!
- Playing card is now server side

Known issue:
- There is not side bet at the start of the round
- The hand is not actually resolved - The code on the server is missing

Todo:
- Backend: resolving the hand
- Backend: do the side bet at the start of the game

Day 11:
- Hand resolver
- Sidebet at the start of the hand
- Handle play cards if folded (push on discarded pile, don't show the discarded card on the board)
- Not sending the list of the discarded card to the client, but only the ammount of them
- Refactored betting
- Redesign of the Table

Known issues:
- After creating a new match, it redirected to the lobby (only the 1st time after the login ?)
- The winner of the first hand is wrong? If the 2 suits are not the same

Todo:
- Handle case where 2 'all-in's, if the first all in is bigger, when the second player calls all-in with less chips the bet need to be re-sized
- Display the correct ammount of opponent cards

Day 12:
- Display the right number of cards in the opponent hand
- Moved few briscolokerHelpers on their own module (Socket.Io)
- Display on the frontend when the round is finished
- Display the end screen when the game ends!
- Handle back to lobby after game ended

Known issue:
- The betting bug for all in is back

ToDo:
- Handle completed game, archive them somewhere

Day 13
- Fixed a typo in betting, might fix the all in bug
- Addded loggin system
- Fixed few betting bugs (All in, starting the hand with no money)

Todo
- Handle if a player has less then the side bet at the start of the round

Known issue:
- After creating a new match, it redirected to the lobby:
  1 instance is when there are more then one game for a user
- Always wait for the MongoDB to be connected
- Random generate the gameRoom name (joinLobby.js)

Day 14

Create a unique room name

Day 15

Added the useless list of game played on the lobby
Refactored the mongoDB module
Fixed the resolve hand bug
Improve a bit the board

Known isssue:
If a player start a game, then login again, he/she shouldn't join the same game as a villan

Todo:
 - After login if there is a game for the player, go to the board (?)
 - Deployment scripts

Day 16

Fixed the re-login and re-join issue
Deployed to Heroku (not working because the DB doesn't exist ...)

Todo:
 - Create a mongodb deployment


Day 19

Changed the timer, now storing the start second of it. Optimized the behaviour onTimer.
Put the timer inside the main game object (se we don't need a different topic)

Issues:
 - It seems that after 30ish card it keeps playing but with only 1 cards per hand
 - TypeError: Cannot read property 'sockets' of undefined at Object.sendAllTheGameStates (/Volumes/Data/Projects/screamingHorseEntretainment/stream/B/briscoloker-socketio/src/modules/briscolokerHelpers.js:73:68)

Todo: 
 - Validate on a middleware (io.use())

 Day 20

Improved timeout
Fixed the API for past games to work with the new token strategy
Reduced the ammount of logs for a single game to 25 (to avoind slowing down the dom)

Day 21

Add creation date and lastLogin date to the userObject in Mongo
Route to remove waiting room

Day 22

Changed the route from /past_game to /user_info
Added user information for the endpoint /user_info

Day 24
