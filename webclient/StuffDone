- Renamed closedRooms to games
- Reconnection to an existing game from '/game'
- Moved 'start game on the server'

Known issues:

Todo:
- Frontend: Delete the code for new game as it is now on the server

Day 10:

- Game is now created after both players joined the lobby (join_lobby)

- Refactored betting
- Redesign of the Table

Known issues:
- After creating a new match, it redirected to the lobby (only the 1st time after the login ?)
- The winner of the first hand is wrong? If the 2 suits are not the same

Todo:
- Handle case where 2 'all-in's, if the first all in is bigger, when the second player calls all-in with less chips the bet need to be re-sized
- Display the correct ammount of opponent cards

- Display the right number of cards in the opponent hand
- Moved few briscolokerHelpers on their own module (Socket.Io)
