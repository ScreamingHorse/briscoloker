Day 9:
- Created the mongo helpers so we can await the DB
- Refactored the joinLobby storing the 'token' and the 'username' on the games collection
- Renamed closedRooms to games
- Reconnection to an existing game from '/game'
- Moved 'start game on the server'

Known issues:
- It seems that everytime a player 'reconnect' to the socket.io (reload the /game page) the server creates a new game

Todo:
- Frontend: Delete the code for new game as it is now on the server

Day 10:

- Game is now created after both players joined the lobby (join_lobby)
- Table ready sends back the state of the match, it doesn't start it
- We are passing the token as QS when connecting to the webSocket
- The betting pahse is on the server now!
- Playing card is now server side

Known issue:
- There is not side bet at the start of the round
- The hand is not actually resolved - The code on the server is missing

Todo:
- Backend: resolving the hand
- Backend: do the side bet at the start of the game

Day 11:
- Hand resolver
- Sidebet at the start of the hand
- Handle play cards if folded (push on discarded pile, don't show the discarded card on the board)
- Not sending the list of the discarded card to the client, but only the ammount of them
- Refactored betting
- Redesign of the Table

Known issues:
- After creating a new match, it redirected to the lobby (only the 1st time after the login ?)
- The winner of the first hand is wrong? If the 2 suits are not the same

Todo:
- Handle case where 2 'all-in's, if the first all in is bigger, when the second player calls all-in with less chips the bet need to be re-sized
- Display the correct ammount of opponent cards

Day 12:
- Display the right number of cards in the opponent hand
- Moved few briscolokerHelpers on their own module (Socket.Io)
- Display on the frontend when the round is finished
- Display the end screen when the game ends!
- Handle back to lobby after game ended

Kwon issue:
- The betting bug for all in is back

ToDo:
- Handle completed game, archive them somewhere
