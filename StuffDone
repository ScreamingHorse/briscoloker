Day 9:
- Created the mongo helpers so we can await the DB
- Refactored the joinLobby storing the 'token' and the 'username' on the games collection
- Renamed closedRooms to games
- Reconnection to an existing game from '/game'
- Moved 'start game on the server'

Known issues:
- It seems that everytime a player 'reconnect' to the socket.io (reload the /game page) the server creates a new game

Todo:
- Frontend: Delete the code for new game as it is now on the server

Day 10:

- Game is now craeted after both players joined the lobby (join_lobby)
- Table ready sends back the state of the match, it doesn't start it
- We are passing the token as QS when connecting to the webSocket
- The betting pahse is on the server now!
- Playing card is now server side

Known issue:
- There is not side bet at the start of the round
- The hand is not actually resolved - The code on the server is missing

Todo:
- Backend: resolving the hand
- Backend: do the side bet at the start of the game
